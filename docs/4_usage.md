#### Chapter 4
## Using *UCHill*
***
This chapter serves as a *TL;DR*, providing some practical examples / guidelines to those readers feeling disinclined to read the more detailed [chapter 3](./3_functionality_details.md) in its entirety.

#### 4.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cooling the vehicle

Use [F1](./3112_driver_passenger_ac.md) in *AM*, adjusting A2 and A3 as needed, combined with [F2](./3112_driver_passenger_ac.md). Also, *unless* the cabin is *colder* than the environment, it actually helps keeping windows, hatches and, if possible, doors, *open*.

#### 4.2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Heating the vehicle

When it is *moderately* or *severely* cold outside, use [F5](./3115_cabin_heaters.md) combined with F1 in *EM*, adjusting A2 and A3 as needed. You can additionally use [F4](./3114_auxiliary_heating.md) to speed up F5's start-up time and, if available in *AM*, [F3](./3113_humidity_management.md), so as to prevent the air inside from drying out too much.

When it is just *mildly* cold to neutral outside, you can either use F1 (in either operational mode) and/or F2, or leverage the engine, as well as, potentially, the [GhE](./3121_greenhouse_effect.md), as an implicit "heat source"; the latter two combined, if given some time, can increase the cabin's temperature by several degrees, even during the winter.

#### 4.3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dehumidifying the vehicle

When dehumidification is your primary concern, your options are as follows:
* Use F3 if available in AM.
* Use F5 if temperature constraints permit it.
* If the air outside is *drier* than the air inside—typically being the case in a cooling context—, allow cabin - environment air exchange by:
    * Opening windows, hatches, and doors.
    * Using F1 and/or F2 in AM, and *A4* set to *FM*.
* Otherwise reduce air exchange by:
    * Closing windows, hatches, and doors.
    * Disabling F1 and F2 if possible, or at least switch A4 to *RM*.

These approaches should also help demist windows that are fogged on the *interior* side.

#### 4.4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Humidifying the vehicle

When humidification is your primary concern, your options are as follows:
* Use F3 is available in AM.
* Disable any heat-contributing function you may be using, if temperature constraints permit doing so.
* If the air outside is *more moist* than the air inside—typically occurring in a heating context—, allow cabin - environment air exchange by:
    * Opening windows, hatches, and doors.
    * Using F1 and/or F2 in AM, and A4 set to FM.
* Otherwise reduce air exchange by:
    * Closing windows, hatches, and doors.
    * Disabling F1 and F2 if possible, or at least switch A4 to RM.
